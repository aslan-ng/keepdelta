Simulation has become an indispensable tool in scientific research and discovery. By mimicking real-world processes in a controlled virtual environment, simulations enable scientists to explore, predict, and understand complex phenomena that may be difficult, expensive, or impossible to study experimentally.

When running a simulation, there are several approaches to saving results, each with its own pros and cons:
1.	Saving the State at Each Step:
Save the entire state of the simulation at every step.
- Pros: All data is preserved, making it easy to access any point in the simulation.
- Cons: Requires significant storage space, especially for long simulations or large datasets.
2.	Saving the Initial State and Logic:
Save only the initial state (including random seeds), the simulation logic (program or code). Then, the reconstruction of results is done by re-running the simulation from scratch.
- Pros: Requires minimal storage space.
- Cons: Time-consuming to reconstruct results, especially for complex or long-running simulations.
3.	Saving the Initial Values and Deltas Across Steps:
Save the initial state and record only the changes (deltas) at each step. Results can be reconstructed incrementally without re-running the entire simulation.
- Pros: Requires less storage than approach 1, and reconstruction is faster than approach 2.
- Cons: Requires more storage than approach 2 and loading results is slower than approach 1.

Python has emerged as a leading programming language for simulations across various scientific and engineering domains. Its versatility, accessibility, and robust ecosystem make it an essential tool for simulating real-world phenomena and solving complex problems.

Why KeepDelta is Useful:
KeepDelta is designed for approach 3, offering a balanced solution between storage efficiency and reconstruction speed. It efficiently manages deltas, making it ideal for simulations where both storage and performance are critical. By adopting this method, users can strike the right balance between resource usage and accessibility.
