# KeepDelta
Efficient Delta Management for Python Data Structures

A lightweight Python library for creating and applying deltas (differences) between two native Python data structures. This is useful for tracking changes in nested data structures such as dictionaries, lists, tuples, sets, and more.

## Features
•	Generate compact delta objects that describe differences between two Python data structures.
•	Apply a delta to an original data structure to reconstruct the updated version.
•	Supports native Python data structures: dict, list, tuple, set, int, float, bool, str, and more.
•	Handles deeply nested and mixed data structures efficiently.

## Installation
Install the package using pip:
``` pip install keepdelta ```
